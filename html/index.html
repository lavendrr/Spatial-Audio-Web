  <p>
    Tranquil Tonescape is a customizable, intuitive ambisonic soundscape meant to help you relax and aid with managing
    stress. Using HTML's Web Audio API & JSAmbisonics, you can create your own soundscape using a bank of
    meditative and relaxing
    sound sources.
  </p>
  <p>
    For each virtual sound source (think of it as a speaker), you have access to controls that change what sound plays
    out of that source, as well as its elevation from -90 to 90 degrees, its volume, and its horizontal 3D position
    using the radar
    control, where north corresponds to the area in front of you.
